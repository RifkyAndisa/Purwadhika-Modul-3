    "Like many machine learning techniques, a recommender system makes prediction based on users’ historical behaviors.

Suppose that me and Stanley have seen the same movies, and we rated them all almost identically. But Stanley hasn’t seen ‘The Godfather: Part II’ and I did. If I love that movie, it sounds logical to think that he will too. With that, we have created an artificial rating based on our similarity.\n",

Analogously, for Item-based CF, we say two items are similar when they received similar ratings from a same user. Then, we will make prediction for a target user on an item by calculating weighted average of ratings on most X similar items from this user. One key advantage of Item-based CF is the stability which is that the ratings on a given item will not change significantly overtime, unlike the tastes of human beings.\n",
